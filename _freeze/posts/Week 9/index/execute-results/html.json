From 1999 reviews largely increased year-on-year which is unsurprising given the growth of Amazon and access to the internet. The dataset shows the peak number of reviews was 2015 with a decline from 2016 to 2018. It is likely that this reflects the dataset being incomplete for recent years rather than the number of reviews declining in reality.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Day 2\n\n## Verified users\n\nThe dataset contains details of whether the review was based on a verified purchase. From [Amazon Community](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G75XTB7MBMBTXP6W:)\n\n> An \"Amazon Verified Purchase\" review means that we've verified that the person writing the review purchased the product from Amazon, and didn't receive the product at a big discount. Reviews that are not marked \"Amazon Verified Purchase\" are valuable as well, but, either we cannot confirm that the product was purchased from Amazon, or that the customer paid a price that is available to most Amazon shoppers.\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Table 2.
