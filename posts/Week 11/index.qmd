```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
budget <- read_csv("data/budget.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r}

# Two ways to do this by listing names or the number of the col. 
# select single column by name
product_dat <- budget %>% select(product) 

# select single column by number
product_dat <- budget %>% select(2) 
```

```{r}
(knitr::kable(product_dat))

```
### Colon Notation 
### Select functions
```{r}
# select columns individually
sales2019 <- budget %>% select(region, product, sales_2019)

# select columns with colon selected the begining and end of the range you would like to have.
sales2019 <- budget %>% select(region:sales_2019)

```


```{r}
# select columns individually
sales2019 <- budget %>% select(region, product, sales_2019)

# select columns with colon
sales2019 <- budget %>% select(region:sales_2019)

regions <- budget %>% select(`Sales Region` = 1, 3:6)

head(regions, 2)
```

```{r}
#Use a subtraction sign to get rid of certain cols.
# de-select individual columns
sales <- budget %>% select(-expenses_2019, -expenses_2020)

# de-select a range of columns
sales <- budget %>% select(-(expenses_2019:expenses_2020))

```


### Filter

```{r}
# select all rows where region equals North
budget %>% filter(region == "North")

# select all rows where expenses_2020 were exactly equal to 200
budget %>% filter(expenses_2020 == 200)

# select all rows where sales_2019 was more than 100
budget %>% filter(sales_2019 > 100)

# everything but the North
budget %>% filter(region != "North")
```
```{r}
# regions and products with profit in both 2019 and 2020
profit_both <- budget %>% 
  filter(
    sales_2019 > expenses_2019,
    sales_2020 > expenses_2020
  )

# the same as above, using & instead of a comma
profit_both <- budget %>% 
  filter(
    sales_2019 > expenses_2019 &
    sales_2020 > expenses_2020
  )

# regions and products with profit in 2019 or 2020
profit_either <- budget %>% 
  filter(
    sales_2019 > expenses_2019 |
    sales_2020 > expenses_2020
  )

# 2020 profit greater than 1000
profit_1000 <- budget %>%
  filter(sales_2020 - expenses_2020 > 1000)
```

### %in%
```{r}
# retain any rows where region is north or south, and where product equals widget
# It will look through the region col and will keep all the ones that say North and South and then filter them by widgets.
budget %>%
  filter(region %in% c("North", "South"),
         product == "widgets")

# retain any rows where the region is not east or west, and where the product does not equal gadgets
budget %>%
  filter(!region %in% c("East", "West"),
         product != "gadgets")
```
### Finding the index, use the which function

```{r}
which(letters %in% "l")
```
```{r}

```

### Arrange prodcuts 

```{r}
# arranging the table 
# first by product in alphabetical order
# then by "region" in reverse alphabetical order
budget %>%
  arrange(product, desc(region))
```
```{r}
budget %>%
  mutate(region = factor(region, levels = c("North", "South", "East", "West"))) %>%
  filter(product == "gadgets") %>%
  arrange(region)
```
# DAY TWO

###Mutate 
```{r}
budget2 <- budget %>%
  mutate(
    sales = sales_2019 + sales_2020,
    expenses = expenses_2019 + expenses_2020,
    profit = sales - expenses,
    region = paste(region, "Office")
  )
```
# Asking if the office made a profit (LOGIC)
```{r}
budget2 <- budget2 %>%
  mutate(profit_category = profit > 0,
         product = as.factor(product))
```
# Profit cat.
```{r}
budget3 <- budget2 %>%
  mutate(profit_category = case_when(profit > 0 ~ "PROFIT",
                                     profit < 0 ~ "NO PROFIT"))
```
# Analyize satisfaction
```{r}
# create a column where people get a bonus if customer satisfaction was overall high or very high

bonus <- budget3 %>%
  mutate(bonus_2019 = case_when(satisfaction_2019 %in% c("very low", "low", "neutral") ~ "no bonus",
                                satisfaction_2019 %in% c("high", "very high") ~ "bonus"))
```

```{r}
# new management takes over - people only get a bonus if customer satisfaction was overall high or very high AND if a profit was returned

bonus2 <- budget3 %>%
  mutate(bonus_2020 = case_when(satisfaction_2020 == "high" & 
                                  profit_category == "PROFIT" ~ "bonus",
                                satisfaction_2020 == "very high" & 
                                  profit_category == "PROFIT" ~ "bonus",
                                TRUE ~ "No bonus")) # set all other values to "no bonus"
```


```{r}
budgettest <- budget %>%
  mutate(
    A = 1,
    B = 1:8,
    c = mean(1:8),
    D = rep(1:2,4)

  )
```


```{r}
paste("North","Office")
paste0("North","Office")
```

# Summarize
```{r}
budget4 <- budget %>%
  select(-satisfaction_2019, -satisfaction_2020) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = sales_2019:expenses_2020,
               names_to = c("type", "year"),
               names_sep = "_",
               values_to = "value") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type,
              values_from = value)

head(budget4) # check the format
```

```{r}
budget4 %>%
  summarise(
    mean_sales = mean(sales),
    mean_expenses = mean(expenses),
    min_profit = min(expenses - sales),
    max_profit = max(expenses - sales)
  )
```
```{r}
year_prod <- budget4 %>%
  group_by(year, product) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_sales = mean(sales),
    mean_expenses = mean(expenses),
    min_profit = min(expenses - sales),
    max_profit = max(expenses - sales)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
