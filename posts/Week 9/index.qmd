# Video Game Review Report

# Number of reviews per year
The below histogram shows the number of video game reviews submitted to Amazon by year. From 1999 reviews largely increased year-on-year which is unsurprising given the growth of Amazon and access to the internet. The dataset shows the peak number of reviews was 2015 with a decline from 2016 to 2018. It is likely that this reflects the dataset being incomplete for recent years rather than the number of reviews declining in reality.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Get number of reviews per year
reviews_by_year <- review_data %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(counts = n())
# plot
ggplot(reviews_by_year, aes(year,counts))+
  geom_bar(stat= "identity",fill="white",color="black")+
  ggtitle(label = "Number of reviews per year",subtitle = "1999 to 2018")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1999:2018) +
  theme_grey()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))+
  xlab("")+
  ylab("")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+ 
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill="lightgrey", 
                                    color = "black")
  )
